				<h1>Port Forwarding a Router</h1>
			</div>
			<p>In this case, it is probably OK to disable your firewall, as you are already being protected by the router.
			
			<p>To forward a port in your router manually:
			
			<div summary="To do this" id="taskbox">
				<ol>
					<li>Find out what your IP address is. 
						<ul>
							<li>In Ubuntu, right click the Network Manager applet in the menu bar, and select 'Connection Information'. The address is probably something like 192.168.1.100, or 10.0.1.2.</li>
							<li>If you don't have Network Manager, open a Terminal and type 'ifconfig'. It will list information for each of your network devices. Find the one you are using, and use the number after 'inet addr:'.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Open Transmission, go to preferences, and enter a number for the port. It is recommended you pick a random number between 49152 and 65535. Let's use 50001 for now. Then quit Transmission.</li>
					<li>Go into your router configuration screen. Normally this is done via your web browser using the address <a href="http://192.168.0.1">192.168.0.1</a> etc.
					<li>Find the port forwarding (sometimes called port mapping) screen. While the page will be different for each router generally you will enter something similar to the following:</li>

						<ul>
							<li>For 'Application' type 'Trans'. </li>
							<li>For 'Start Port' and 'End port' type in the port you chose in Step 2. eg 50001. </li>
							<li>For Protocol, choose Both. </li>
							<li>For IP address, type in your IP address you found in Step 1. eg 10.0.1.2. </li>
							<li>Check Enable. </li>
							<li>Click save settings. </li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
